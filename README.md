Disable your usb ports or just disable your usb storage controller!  (RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR)

I made this project for my laptop. Your PC is not safe when you afk on public. Someone tried to hack my PC on Starbucks. I went to WC and when I came back I saw a USB plugged to my PC and my PC is trying to restart. I fixed my PC and started to write this project. I finished it now(1 year later). I recommend using it on laptops.

THIS PROJECT USES DEVCON. ITS TOTALLY SAFE. YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/devcon
###### What you can do:

- You can disable all USB ports **(Not recommended! If you're using laptop you can disable all ports. You can enable it again with your touchpad.)**
- You can disable USB Storage Controller. Your USB Mouse or Keyboard or something else will work but if something contains storage on USB ports it will not work.
- You can enable your USB ports or Storage Controller.

It's a simple project. This project will protect your USB ports vulnerability.
